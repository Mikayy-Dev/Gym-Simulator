# Gym-Simulator v0.2

## Movement/Controls
WASD to move. You are a gym employee tasked with keeping the gym tidy during open hours. 
When a '!' appears on a machine Right-Click the red box to clean that machine or pick up weights off the floor.
Left-Click Dumbbell/Squat racks to re-insert the weights back.
Left-Shift to sprint

## Gameplay
Gameplay is very minimal, no progression or rank up of any kind yet. This is a very early development build. 
If you are given access to this repo do not hold back, I want to know everything you dislike/like. 
If you are unsure as to what something is message me.

## Disclaimer
Some assets are not fully implemented yet. There are placeholders and or non first party sprites but about 90% of what you see is create by me.
